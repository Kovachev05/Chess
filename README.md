# Chess
An 800x800 chess program, with similar asthetics to chess.com, but built in c++

#Installation
To run the program, navigate to the bin folder and run the chess.exe (In the future i might add a set up wizard that creates a shortcut)

#Work in progress
There is still a lot of work to be done, so the game might still not feel very polished
