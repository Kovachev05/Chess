## Installation
To run the program, navigate to the bin folder and run the chess.exe (In the future i might add a set up wizard that creates a shortcut)

## Unique sound design
When capturing a piece, a satisfying sound is made

## Work in progress
There is still a lot of work to be done, so the game might still not feel very polished
